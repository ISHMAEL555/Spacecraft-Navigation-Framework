# Navigation

A high-fidelity Python framework for spacecraft **attitude determination**, **attitude estimation**, and **sensor simulation**.

The objective of this repository is to develop a modular, verifiable, and extensible spacecraft navigation library following aerospace engineering principles. The framework models spacecraft attitude dynamics, realistic sensor measurements, classical attitude determination algorithms, and recursive state estimation techniques.

# Development Workflow

Each module is developed using the following engineering workflow:

```text
Requirements
      ↓
Implementation
      ↓
Unit Testing
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Integration
```

Every module is verified before it is integrated into the simulation framework.

# Verification Philosophy

This repository follows a verification-first development approach.

Every mathematical model is verified using automated unit tests before being integrated into higher-level navigation algorithms.

Verification includes:

- Mathematical property verification
- Numerical consistency checks
- Coordinate transformation validation
- Monte Carlo analysis (planned)
- Statistical consistency checks (planned)
